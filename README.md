## Challenge Overview
Update Election Result with the following additional information
  - The voter turnout for each county.
  - The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
  - The county with the highest turnout.

## Challenge Summary
I struggled at the end of this challenge to find the mistake in my code to generate the County Votes and Largest County Turnout.
However, the data code followed the same struture throughout the code. I was able to produce the total votes, percent and vote count per candidate and the winner.
